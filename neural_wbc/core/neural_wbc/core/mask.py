    """
    Create a mask where all enabled states are set to 1.
    This mask can be used directly or multiplied with 0.5 and then be used as the probability of
    a state being enabled.

    Args:
        mask_element_names: The name corresponding to every element in the mask.
        mask_modes: A nested dictionary configuring which mask elements are enabled in which mode.
            The nested dictionary takes the form `{mode_name: {body_region: [element_names]}}`
            The `mode_name` and `body_region` can be chosen freely, they are just for documentary
            value. The `element_names` may also use regex patterns.
            An example configuration is:

            "exbody": {
                "upper_body": [".*torso_joint.*", ".*shoulder.*joint.*", ".*elbow.*joint.*"],
                "lower_body": ["root.*"],
            },

            For every `mode_name`, all elements of all body regions in that mode will be enabled.
            Most likely you want the elements specified in one body region to not
            overlap with other body regions (the code will still work if they do overlap, but the
            resulting trained policy may not work when the overlapping elements are disabled at test
            time).

        enable_sparsity_randomization: If enabled random elements of the mask will be disabled with
            probability 0.5. The current randomization strategy aligns with the paper, but can be improved
            to avoid motion ambiguity. For example, one viable strategy is to only enable the mask dropout
            on a small portion of elements of the same body region.

        torch.Tensor: A tensor of shape (len(goal_state_names),) containing the mask.
